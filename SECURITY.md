## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report any security vulnerabilities in the project, please follow these steps:

1. Visit the project's issue tracking system on GitHub at [https://github.com/AsP3X/FixWinUp/issues](https://github.com/AsP3X/FixWinUp/issues). 

2. Click on "New Issue" and select the template that best describes your report - either a bug or vulnerability report. This will guide you through creating an issue tailored to reporting a vulnerability in this project's codebase.

After submitting your new vulnerability report:

- You can expect updates from us as we investigate and address the reported vulnerabilities. 
- If the vulnerability is accepted, it means that it has been fixed and will be included in future releases of FixWinUp software. 
- However, please note that we cannot promise any specific timeline for these patches or their release. We work with the latest security updates frequently.

Please remember to keep your report concise and precise; this helps us understand and resolve vulnerabilities more effectively. Thank you for helping make our project safer!
